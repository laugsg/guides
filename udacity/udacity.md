## 5. Questions
### 1. General Questions
### 2. Tech assesment ("placement test")
It is one assessment for the whole learning path (there are multiple assessments, but they overlap), it should recommend a list of nano-degrees you are ready for, including ones in different learning paths.

It is 45min/1hr placement test, could be quicker. Learner should allow that time to complete the assessment that must be complete before being approved to enrol an intermediate or specialist nanodegree.

Learners, can do multiple (different) assessments (they are free).

Foundational nanodegrees require no assessment.

A lerner is allowed to enroll only into those paths that the placement test reveal It is are prepared to.

> You can do one assessment, be ready to enrol on the intermediate course or do another assessment for a different path and choose before you are committed and enrol, or enter into any foundational level nanodegree.

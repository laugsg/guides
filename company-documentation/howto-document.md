# How-To Document an unknown system
Usually a developer documents about its code, into the code itself or in README file. Sometimes it couldn't even exist at all.

Usually this kind of documentation, is writen from a local perspective.

To document a system it's needed a global landscape, then it would ideal to identify the services and/or preject that compose it, delimitate as single pieces, finally describe the tasks each of them resolves.

It is a process that goes from the whole to pieces, description is focused on inputs/outputs and how the pieces relates with each other.

It is as standard and iterative process: when a piece is identified it could be taken as the whole, description is focused on inputs/outputs and how their pieces relates with each other as mechanism.

## Methodology
Usually, documentation begins with data, then starts a process of data refinement, finally a slim but robust corpus is produced.

When data location is unknown documentation begins with people. Interviews are set with the purpose to collect the testimony from developers who built the system because the specifications and details they have achieved compose the technical blueprint of the software, project or tool and their narrative.

Then, documentation becomes a robust technical description in an eighty percent, to know the "How-To use or extend", and a twenty percent slim explanatory, to know the "Why & How pieces are together or data flows".

Finally, documentation is presented as a map, which narrates an explanation of it shape and gives an operation manual.

A map, which narrates an explanation of it shape and behaviour, to help the reader knows where is what its looking for, and gives an operation manual to help the reader how to introduce new code or modify the previously existed.
